KNOWN BUGS / FEATURE REQUESTS
    CRITICAL: Must fix now! If not fixed, the system will perform SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENTLY THAN INTENDED
    MAJOR: Fix as soon as possible. If not fixed, we will be heavily docked points on the final presentation
    MINOR: Fix after major bugs are finished. If not fixed, we will be lightly docked points on the final presentation
    FEATURE REQUEST: Fix if there is time. If not fixed, we may get docked points, or may just not get extra credit

[CRITICAL] No logic for adding courses (functions to implement: addCourse(), bestQuarterToAdd())

[CRITICAL] Only one major implemented

[MAJOR] Every course in the course plan still says 'something' (Needs to be fixed in both all_courses.js and objects.js)

[MINOR] Switching majors only works once (CSE->WDE), no way to go back to CSE from WDE
    - Does this change also alter windows.allCourses? It must, or the system will not work.

[MINOR] Console Log Clutter / No useful console log info

[FEATURE REQUEST] No Honors/LEAD courses

[FEATURE REQUEST] Window Resizing
	- (Scott): I like to only use half of my screen real estate for the application, but
			   CSS Styles are hard-coded for a full screen (looks awkward). Is there any
			   quick-ish ways to remedy this?

CHANGELOG


[FIXED] Not Printer Friendly
	- @media print query added to styles/stylesheet.css
	- Part of the problem with the original printing is that page elements are strictly
	  defined (spacing, etc.)

[FIXED] Broken AP Tests: Physics C (Both), Calculus BC, Comp. Sci A
	- JP fixed this with the AP Score resetting to 3 issue. However, a 5 on the Comp
	  Sci A Test still has the student taking COEN 10 while removing COEN 11.  Shouldn't
	  we remove both? (JORDAN: Yes, we should. I added it.)

[FIXED] Comp. Sci A gives credit for COEN10 as well as COEN11

[FIXED] Most Transfer Credit Transactions Have Some 'undefined' Error
    - See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/96a7a8439f1a606c22f3eff2caf2228107063a7e
    - Jordan: preComputeScheduleTransferCSE() was calling computeNewScheduleCSE(), but was not passing removal requests in correctly

[FIXED] Testing out of CHEM11 would put PHYS33 in its place
    - See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/9973c2313f297926c7c2337b8579d17f81a1c812

[FIXED] Physics: E&M AP Credit gives a TypeError: Cannot read property 'PHYS33' of undefined
[FIXED] Physics: Getting a qualified grade on Calculus 1 after testing out of MATH9 gives a TypeError: Cannot read property 'MATH9' of undefined
    - See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/19770ae47db03a0364335507dc273862d284556a

[FIXED] Physics: E&M Transfer Credit is Broken (TypeError: Cannot read property 'branch' of undefined)
[FIXED] Physics: Physics C: Mechanics AP credit is broken
    - See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/bd33cbb5650555b20e117fb644a2fde14424a209
    - Jordan: ID's for some transfer credits were off by 1

[FIXED] CompSci 2 transfer credit TypeError: Cannot read property 'branch' of undefined
[FIXED] CompSci A credit TypeError: Cannot read property 'branch' of undefined
    -See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/eb9e10a62e3ce9197952da3ffcb94a67985b0a63
    -Scott: Return if branch is undefined (no prerequisites for the next class in the series I think?)

[FIXED] C&I 1/2 should be added in consecutive quarters that have CORE classes

[FIXED] ENGR1 should be added to the quarter with the least amount of labs
    - See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/97664f1192fe55d52dc91c2567a39f2797555ccb

[FIXED] fix AP scores based on real criteria
	-AP environmental science gets out of CHEM 11
	-4,5 on AP Chemistry exam gets student out of AMTH 106 in addition to CHEM 11
    -See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/ae5fbbb5c7d45cc2366022c79a6959cd47fc992e

[FIXED] rearrange Math course sequence:  9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 106, 108, 53
    -See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/824cdf0f891cf6eaa899fc640db483aeeb4e7d09
