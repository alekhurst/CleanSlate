***[CRUCIAL]*** Physics: E&M Transfer Credit is Broken

***[CRUCIAL]*** Most Transfer Credit Transactions Have Some 'undefined' Error

**[MINOR]** Calculus BC test only has one criteria for getting class grades (4-5), while there should be a second one that gives credit for MATH11 (3-4) 

*[OK DEMO]* Not Printer Friendly

*[OK DEMO]* Console Log Clutter
 
*[OK DEMO]* Every course in the course plan still says 'something'

*[OK DEMO]* Multiple Scores on Same Test Produce Backend Issues (Classes 'undefined')

*[OK DEMO]* No Backend Logic to Remove AP Tests (apparently)

[FIXED] Broken AP Tests: Physics C (Both), Calculus BC, Comp. Sci A
	- JP fixed this with the AP Score resetting to 3 issue. However, a 5 on the Comp
	  Sci A Test still has the student taking COEN 10 while removing COEN 11.  Shouldn't
	  we remove both? (JORDAN: Yes, we should. I added it.)
