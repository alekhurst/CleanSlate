KNOWN BUGS / FEATURE REQUESTS
    CRITICAL: Must fix now! If not fixed, the system will perform SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENTLY THAN INTENDED
    MAJOR: Fix as soon as possible. Very time constaining and/or will cost us significant points if not fixed
    MINOR: Fix after major bugs are finished. Minorly time consuming and/or will cost us minor points if not fixed
    FEATURE REQUEST: Fix if there is time. If not fixed, we may get docked points, or may just not get extra credit

	
	
[CRITICAL] No logic for adding courses (functions to implement: addCourse(), bestQuarterToAdd())

[FEATURE REQUEST] Console Log Clutter / No useful console log info
	- (Scott): I understand using console logs in development.  I'd just like to comment 
			   them out so writing to console log doesn't require looking for a needle
			   in a haystack with other's log statements.

[FEATURE REQUEST] No Honors/LEAD courses

[FEATURE REQUEST] Window Resizing
	- (Scott): I like to only use half of my screen real estate for the application, but
			   CSS Styles are hard-coded for a full screen (looks awkward). Is there any
			   quick-ish ways to remedy this?
			   
[FEATURE REQUEST] Remove transfer_credit.txt and Add flag for potential credit within all_courses.txt.
	- (Scott): It would make configuration go a lot smoother...(one place...)

CHANGELOG

[FIXED] Only one major implemented
	- WDE "supported" around 5:33PM Friday
	- (Scott): May want to be more specific on the bugs here.

[FIXED] Cannot 'remove' AP Credit / Transfer Credit
	- Removal implemented through usage of a Modification Log
	- (Scott):
			==========
			   RANT
			==========

			Okay.  I was trying to figure out the great mystery of how to reverse the removal of courses.  I did a couple of things
				(1) I'm keeping a record of all the changes made to the schedule in a Modification Log, which associates changes
					by an id.
				(2) Instead of changing the working schedule incrementally, it reloads and recomputes each time something changes
					- It also reloads the AllCourses object (since it gets changed in the process
					- THIS MAY BE GOOD TO STRESS TEST.
				(3) Instead of pre-computing from AP Test / Transfer Credit, it computes the changes, saves them in the Modification Log
					under an appropriate ID to be used later.
				(4) Items are removed from the Modification Log with removeMods(id), which finds the entry and deletes it (so it is no 
					longer factored into the calculation).
				(5) Remove buttons are active and should work appropriately.
				
			Honestly, I'm not even sure if this was a useful venture. I feel like a horse with blinders on.  This feels like a significant
			paradigm shift from where we were.  I'm not sure if it's an improvement.  I may regret this in a couple hours, but...whatever.

			Thanks.

			- Scott

[FIXED] Application does not retain AP Credit / Transfer Credit when Major is Switched.
	- (Scott): I would personally find it annoying if I had to input everything twice if I
			   only wanted to compare majors.
    - (Jordan): Another option we could do is to check the working schedule against the default
               schedule, and if they're different upon switching majors, alert the user that
               changing majors will clear all saved data.
	- AP Tests and Transfer Credits are retained in Angular and in Modification Log now.
			   
[FIXED] COEN courses should not be shifted
    -(Jordan): Best fix ever. I just changed the offerings of COEN courses. Brilliant.
    - See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/82429cf05b761a83370e9797744eeea55d4cc231

[FIXED] Every course in the course plan still says 'something' (Needs to be fixed in both all_courses.js and objects.js)
	- index.html was using the 'description'.  We want the course plan to have the course names.

[FIXED] Switching majors only works once (CSE->WDE), no way to go back to CSE from WDE
    - Does this change also alter windows.allCourses? It must, or the system will not work.
	- Line was missing in view_controller.js
	- (Scott): I have not, however, checked if AP Scores, Transfer Credit is reflected during the switch.
	

[FIXED] Not Printer Friendly
	- @media print query added to styles/stylesheet.css
	- Part of the problem with the original printing is that page elements are strictly
	  defined (spacing, etc.)

[FIXED] Broken AP Tests: Physics C (Both), Calculus BC, Comp. Sci A
	- JP fixed this with the AP Score resetting to 3 issue. However, a 5 on the Comp
	  Sci A Test still has the student taking COEN 10 while removing COEN 11.  Shouldn't
	  we remove both? (JORDAN: Yes, we should. I added it.)

[FIXED] Comp. Sci A gives credit for COEN10 as well as COEN11

[FIXED] Most Transfer Credit Transactions Have Some 'undefined' Error
    - See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/96a7a8439f1a606c22f3eff2caf2228107063a7e
    - Jordan: preComputeScheduleTransferCSE() was calling computeNewScheduleCSE(), but was not passing removal requests in correctly

[FIXED] Testing out of CHEM11 would put PHYS33 in its place
    - See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/9973c2313f297926c7c2337b8579d17f81a1c812

[FIXED] Physics: E&M AP Credit gives a TypeError: Cannot read property 'PHYS33' of undefined
[FIXED] Physics: Getting a qualified grade on Calculus 1 after testing out of MATH9 gives a TypeError: Cannot read property 'MATH9' of undefined
    - See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/19770ae47db03a0364335507dc273862d284556a

[FIXED] Physics: E&M Transfer Credit is Broken (TypeError: Cannot read property 'branch' of undefined)
[FIXED] Physics: Physics C: Mechanics AP credit is broken
    - See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/bd33cbb5650555b20e117fb644a2fde14424a209
    - Jordan: ID's for some transfer credits were off by 1

[FIXED] CompSci 2 transfer credit TypeError: Cannot read property 'branch' of undefined
[FIXED] CompSci A credit TypeError: Cannot read property 'branch' of undefined
    -See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/eb9e10a62e3ce9197952da3ffcb94a67985b0a63
    -Scott: Return if branch is undefined (no prerequisites for the next class in the series I think?)

[FIXED] C&I 1/2 should be added in consecutive quarters that have CORE classes

[FIXED] ENGR1 should be added to the quarter with the least amount of labs
    - See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/97664f1192fe55d52dc91c2567a39f2797555ccb

[FIXED] fix AP scores based on real criteria
	-AP environmental science gets out of CHEM 11
	-4,5 on AP Chemistry exam gets student out of AMTH 106 in addition to CHEM 11
    -See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/ae5fbbb5c7d45cc2366022c79a6959cd47fc992e

[FIXED] rearrange Math course sequence:  9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 106, 108, 53
    -See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/824cdf0f891cf6eaa899fc640db483aeeb4e7d09
