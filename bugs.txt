**[MINOR]** No Honors/LEAD courses (this might be OK for demo)

**[MINOR]** Logic to Add Classes Back ? (Or Reset?)	
	
*[OK DEMO]* Not Printer Friendly

*[OK DEMO]* Console Log Clutter
 
*[OK DEMO]* Every course in the course plan still says 'something'

*[OK DEMO]* Multiple Scores on Same Test Produce Backend Issues (Classes 'undefined')

*[OK DEMO]* No Backend Logic to Remove AP Tests (apparently)

[FIXED] Broken AP Tests: Physics C (Both), Calculus BC, Comp. Sci A
	- JP fixed this with the AP Score resetting to 3 issue. However, a 5 on the Comp
	  Sci A Test still has the student taking COEN 10 while removing COEN 11.  Shouldn't
	  we remove both? (JORDAN: Yes, we should. I added it.)

[FIXED] Comp. Sci A gives credit for COEN10 as well as COEN11

[FIXED] Most Transfer Credit Transactions Have Some 'undefined' Error
    - See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/96a7a8439f1a606c22f3eff2caf2228107063a7e
    - Jordan: preComputeScheduleTransferCSE() was calling computeNewScheduleCSE(), but was not passing removal requests in correctly

[FIXED] Testing out of CHEM11 would put PHYS33 in its place
    - See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/9973c2313f297926c7c2337b8579d17f81a1c812

[FIXED] Physics: E&M AP Credit gives a TypeError: Cannot read property 'PHYS33' of undefined
[FIXED] Physics: Getting a qualified grade on Calculus 1 after testing out of MATH9 gives a TypeError: Cannot read property 'MATH9' of undefined
    - See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/19770ae47db03a0364335507dc273862d284556a

[FIXED] Physics: E&M Transfer Credit is Broken (TypeError: Cannot read property 'branch' of undefined)
[FIXED] Physics: Physics C: Mechanics AP credit is broken
    - See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/bd33cbb5650555b20e117fb644a2fde14424a209
    - Jordan: ID's for some transfer credits were off by 1

[FIXED] CompSci 2 transfer credit TypeError: Cannot read property 'branch' of undefined
[FIXED] CompSci A credit TypeError: Cannot read property 'branch' of undefined
    -See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/eb9e10a62e3ce9197952da3ffcb94a67985b0a63
    -Scott: Return if branch is undefined (no prerequisites for the next class in the series I think?)

[FIXED] C&I 1/2 should be added in consecutive quarters that have CORE classes

[FIXED] ENGR1 should be added to the quarter with the least amount of labs
    - See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/97664f1192fe55d52dc91c2567a39f2797555ccb

[FIXED] fix AP scores based on real criteria
	-AP environmental science gets out of CHEM 11
	-4,5 on AP Chemistry exam gets student out of AMTH 106 in addition to CHEM 11
    -See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/ae5fbbb5c7d45cc2366022c79a6959cd47fc992e

[FIXED] rearrange Math course sequence:  9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 106, 108, 53
    -See https://github.com/alekhurst/CleanSlate/commit/824cdf0f891cf6eaa899fc640db483aeeb4e7d09
